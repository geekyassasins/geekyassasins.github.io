<p><strong>1. Tell us something about the different types of companies coming to BIT for placements and
the company you are placed in.</strong><br>
There are three to four types of companies that visit BIT Mesra: Software companies,
consultancies (prefer those who have good communication and representation skills) and core
companies.<br>
I am placed in a startup â€“ Tech Robotics. It is an off campus placement.<br>
<strong>2. What is your job platform?(hardware/software/management)</strong><br>
I have been recruited as an Image processing engineer. The job platform is software.<br>
<strong>3. What must be the basis of selection of a company for a student?</strong><br>
In my case I already had a PPO in Ad Innovations, Silicon Mentor. I would suggest students to
choose what they are passionate about.<br>
I focused mostly on startups because they provide opportunities where one can work to the best
of their capabilities. Also, they provide the platform where innovation is constant rather than
doing 9 am to 5 pm monotonous jobs.<br>
<strong>4. Tell us about your selection process.</strong><br>
After the end of third year I went for summer internship in Silicon Mentor. I had an interview over
Skype and then a telephonic interview. They did not ask much technical questions. I guess they
just wanted to check how interested I was about image processing. There were around 30
summer interns at Silicon Mentor. We were allotted projects in groups of three or four. At the
end, three or four interns were offered a PPO. I am glad that I was amongst the selected ones.
In seventh semester, I went for Grey Orange for two important reasons. Firstly, it is a startup.
Secondly, it allowed EEE students for the profile of firmware engineer which involved image
processing. There were three rounds other than Personal Interview. Firstly it was aptitude round
which had questions from electronics and microcontrollers. Next was coding round which had
three questions and it lasted for an hour. We could use any language for our solution provided
the solution should pass all the test cases. After shortlisting around fourteen people in the
penultimate round, a single long question was given. We had to suggest the answer in form of
pseudo code using the concepts of microcontrollers and image processing. Six of us were
shortlisted after this for Personal Interview. It was an intense interview session over telephone. I
thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I could not make it through.
Next, I appeared for Aakash Institute mostly because of my love for teaching and my good grasp
over concepts of Mathematics at 10+2 level. It was a cake walk. However, this was not what I
dreamt of.<br>
I kept applying in startups right from the beginning of seventh semester. I donâ€™t remember a
single website which I had not explored while looking up for the kind of job that I wanted. It was in
eighth semester when I got a call from Tech Robotics saying they wanted to interview me. And to
my surprise, I got a call at around 2.30 a.m. for the interview. They asked me about the research
paper which I did in the summer internship previous year, questions about things I did in four
years of engineering. It went good and they said that I will be informed later. The very next
morning they mailed me a project which has to be implemented in OpenCV and I had to update
them with my daily progress. And to add to my woes, I was not that proficient in Open CV till
then. It required a marathon effort to complete the task and luckily I pulled it off. I remember
slogged hours, worked day in and day out to complete the task.<br>
<strong>5. Is this what you had actually aimed for?</strong><br>
Absolutely yes. I aimed to work for a startup, work for a profile which emphasizes on research
work and I am glad I achieved it.<br>
<strong>6. Tell us something about the role of club activities in your placement.</strong><br>
Club activities add to your personality development. You meet new people, interact with them.
Your interpersonal skills will surely flourish.<br>
I remember having big time stage phobia. Being part of club I had to come up front, present
myself and that helped me alienate my fear of stage. Also you get to manage a lot of things for
your club and learn multitasking. Overall it helps in building up confidence.<br>
<strong>7. Tell us something about the role of different projects and research papers.</strong><br>
Good projects are the back bone of resume. A hard working person who have decent skill set is
what companies look for. Projects reflect what you are capable of and how much effort you have
done.<br>
<strong>8. What is the importance of CGPA cut-off in placements?</strong><br>
CGPA plays role in very trivial manner. Yes, you must score decently say above 7.5. But ask me,
CGPA does not reflect what you are capable of. No offence to high CGPA holders.<br>
<strong>9. Do the backlogs have a negative impact in placements?</strong><br>
Generally HRs tend to segregate those who have back papers mentioned in the resume. You
cannot deny the truth. Having said that, it does not comply that people with back in subject will
not be placed. One should back their strengths.<br>
<strong>10. What was your interview standout question?</strong><br>
During my interview with Tech Robotics, they asked me about what I have done in 8 semesters
of engineering. Once I started answering, I kept speaking unceasingly. I could feel the positive
vibes from their side in the subsequent questions.<br>
<strong>11. What must be the skills involved to get through the placement?</strong><br>
Carry three basic things with you â€“ Confidence, Communication and Representation.<br>
<strong>12. What do you think must be the time when a student should start thinking about their
placement?</strong><br>
In my case, I aimed to work with startups and not many startups come in campus placements.
One has to look for off campus opportunities. So, I started mailing different startups around one
month after the seventh semester began.<br>
<strong>13. How to write an impressive resume? (matters to be included in it)</strong><br>
One should not write resume as a chapter of any book. It should be short and precise. Always
mention your strengths. Do not write anything just to impress because it can backfire.<br>
<strong>14. What advice will you like to give to your juniors?</strong><br>
Always do what you are passionate about. Decide your goal and do not stop until you reach
there. The feeling of achievement is not something that can be expressed in words. It is more
than anything like satisfaction. Once you achieve something you will get to know.<br>
<strong>15. What are your plans for future studies?(if any)</strong><br>
Of course yes. I am a research oriented person. I have planned to go for further studies may be
after two or three years.<br></p>
