<h4><span class=":#000000" >PROFILE</span> <span class="#46061D" >:Associate Enginee</span></h4>
<p><b>Tell us something about your college life. Your experiences in BIT.</b><br><br>
My college life revolved around my clubs. I have been associated with Rotaract and
Robolution. One club has enhanced my management skills and the other has enhanced
my technical skills. Mainly that&#39;s my college life.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the company in which you have been placed. Are you planning
to take up the offer or are you planning to pursue higher studies?</b><br><br>
Qualcomm as you must know is a chip manufacturing company for mobile phones it
manufactures microprocessors for mobiles as well as application based processor for
mobiles. I will be taking up the job at Qualcomm, no plans of higher studies in near
future.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the placement process at the company.</b><br><br>
Qualcomm had an online test which consisted of Quantitative and Technical parts
related to electronics and coding (Not full-fledged coding). After we were selected from
the test we had our interviews. Normally there are two technical interviews and a HR
interview but I had three technical interviews and one HR interview.<br><br><br>
<b>How important is the CGPA factor in placement?</b><br><br>
CGPA can be considered good as well as bad. Like some companies do not take the high
CGPA candidates, thinking that you may go for higher studies and may not continue for
long in the firm. But having a low CGPA is a risk as you may not qualify the basic
eligibility criteria. So it&#39;s always preferred to have a moderate CGPA like 7.5 to 8.5. I am
not saying that getting a high CGPA is bad but it might go against you. I would like to
advise my juniors to maintain a good CGPA, as no matter what you don&#39;t want to get
rejected just because of your CGPA, like at one instance I did not fulfil the CGPA criteria
at Stellium which was one of the first companies to visit BIT.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the projects and internships that you undertook?</b><br><br>
Projects help a lot in placements, projects and summer internships helped a lot in
placement. My projects were based around embedded systems and image processing, So
were my internships.I have done internships at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Delhi and a total
of 3 internships. The IIT Kharagpur and the home based IIT Delhi internship were in the
same year. The very next year I did full time internship at IIT Delhi.<br><br><br>
<b>How to apply for internships?</b><br><br>
Most of the IITs open summer Research program through which you can apply, but what
actually helps is having contact with the professors at these IIT as it increases your
chances of getting an internship. For instance in IIT Delhi there are very few openings
and a very limited number of opportunities are given. So having a relative who has
contacts with professor always helps. Always prefer academic internships over industrial
internships, like in some cases people give say 5000 rupees and do an internship at an
MNC just for the sake of getting a certificate.<br><br><br>

<b>What are the technical skills (like embedded systems, PLC SCADA, coding
etc.) that may give one a technical edge over other?</b><br><br>
Of course! See whenever you are sitting for some placement drive, one thing that
everyone should think about is your unique selling point (USP), like everyone in this
college studies his or her share of Academics, most of them stay between 7.5 and 8.5
GPA, but you need something special in you so that the company selects you, so you will
always have to understand what is that unique special thing in you. For me it was image
processing not many people in our college work on image processing. Not many do it in
open CV or in open source. I think only around 10 people do it leaving out the CSE
branch who had it as one of the subjects, in EEE only two to three people do it. So that
was my unique selling point. In Qualcomm I gave my full interview in the image
processing domain.<br><br><br>
<b>Questions from which subject were asked the most during the interview
process?</b><br><br>
The basic questions were related to image processing and signal processing combined.
They asked me if an image was passed through a low pass filter or a high pass filter what
would be the changed output. They asked me questions on edge detection. I had a project
on barcode and QR code so they also asked me about it too. They also asked me about
the badminton playing robot I had made with Robolution. So more or less it was from
my resume itself.<br><br><br>
<b>What does it take for an EEE undergraduate to be placed in a coding or core
based company?</b><br><br>
During my interviews I had met many people. Many of them wanted to go to core
companies and many not. Speaking of BIT, not many core companies regularly visit it,
only Tata Steel visits regularly. Although Qualcomm visits, it does not allow EEE
students (EEE students were allowed this time). Trident visits on alternate years. If you
think that you don&#39;t want to go to a core company and instead want to be placed in a
coding company then you should switch over as soon as possible. Do participate in
online coding competitions like code chef and CQM. You need to be good in what you do.
You cannot be moderate in everything. If one is not interested in coding he can stick only
to core. Off campus you have a lot of options, you also have the GATE exam and can also
apply for PSUs. If you think you are good at core then you should stick to whatever you
are good at and just not switch over because not many core companies visit your college.
You should stick to whatever your interest is and not just look for placement.<br><br><br>
<b>Do you have any experience with the off-campus placement process? What
are the chances of getting a job through the same?</b><br><br>
Yes I know my friends and my seniors who applied for off campus and got placed.
Basically when you apply off campus there are two ways. One is going through the
official website and career pages whenever they have opening they will check your
resume and if they find your resume interesting they will give you a call. And the second
way is to go through contacts, Build contacts and then go through it. Like you may
increase your network over LinkedIn and talk to employers and know when there are
openings available. And probably you will get a referral if they find your profile
interesting. So these are the two ways.<br><br><br>
<b>What are the topics that are generally given for Group Discussion in
interviews? Some tips about Group Discussions.</b><br><br>

Don’t fight. It is called a group discussion for a reason you have to listen to the
viewpoints of everyone and then give your conclusions and put forward your views to
everybody so that everybody can judge your views. Do proper analysis of whatever topic
is given to you and then put forward your views. I haven&#39;t given any group discussion
since Tata Steel visit for internship in 2015. The topic given to our group was “Are the
Bullet trains good for Indian infrastructure or not”.<br><br><br>
<b>How does publishing a technical paper benefit one when it comes to
placement?</b><br><br>
Depends, might or might not. Because there are two things if you have published a
technical paper it tells that you are a technically sound guy but certain companies do feel
that if you have a technical paper you might change your mind about continuing with the
company and you might go for higher studies M.Tech or PHD.<br><br><br>
<b>Any general advice to your juniors. Your thoughts and suggestions. And
some cherished moments that you will take with you.</b><br><br>
College is an integral part of one&#39;s life. Like the 4 years in college, how they passed I can&#39;t
really imagine. And as a general advice to my juniors non-technically as a friend to
friend, live these 4 years properly and don&#39;t get any black dot. And as senior I will say try
to generate your USP (Unique Selling Point) because that will give you an edge over the
others. Speaking of cherish moments, most of them were not in the college like the
participation in the Robocon, the feeling at that time and the excitement of the late night
work during BITOTSAV and the social service in Rotaract. Like I said I will always
remember the things that I did in my clubs and with my club mates.</p>
