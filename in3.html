<p><strong>Journey in BIT:</strong>
The four years in BIT was full of fun and frolic. In my first year, after a good rank in AIEEE, I was more
focussed towards studies with an equal inclination to sports like cricket and volleyball which I had left
since my 8th standard. My hostel was with seniors of ME who were very supportive. I have a good
engineering background, my brother is an engineer in NTPC who gave me good guidance. The second
year was as if I had actually landed onto the world of electrical and electronics with subjects like Machines
and EEGC proving the same.
From this point the real engineering starts. For the third year I would say was a bit hectic with MU lab and
power electronics lab, I hardly got any time for anything else. It was all academics that I concentrated on,
then slowly and gradually with hard work came the 4thyear, after placement in 7thsem, I am reliving those
days of my college life, the first year.<br>
<strong>TRAINING AND PROJECTS:</strong><br>
I YEAR: After my second semester I went for a training in NTPC, the topic of the training was power
transformer which made the second year subjects like EEGC and Machines interesting.<br>
II YEAR: After the fourth semester I went to SAIL, Bokaro for a two months training. I learnt to know
how manufacturing works.<br>
III YEAR: I was a TATA STEEL INTERN, after asking questions in technical the interviewer went to my
resume which was solid and asked me questions related to my training in NTPC and was impressed with
the answers I gave.<br>
CORE VS NON-CORE: After all my three internships in core it came to my mind that a job in core can be
a very tedious task, I used to work 12 hours a day in my intern which I found to be a relatively tough task.
Also after speaking to my seniors in both Core and Non-Core, l arrived on the conclusion that there is
much scope of growth with a much better working atmosphere in the latter than the former. But if you are
really interested in your stream go with a Core job or Gate.<br>
ABOUT EXL SERVICES: EXL Service is a provider of decision-analytics, operation management,
outsourcing, business transformation and IT services. EXL's services are structured around insurance,
banking, financial services, utilities, healthcare, transportation and travel industries.<br>
ROUNDS INVOLVED: Around 480 students appeared for the test. Anyone with no current backlog could
appear for the test. There were three rounds in EXL.<br>
1. Written: 40 questions of 45 minutes Aptitude: 20 questions (easy if practiced) English: 10
questions(general) Logical Reasoning: 10 questions.
After the first round 28 students were shortlisted and my name was not there in the list. Meanwhile I was
preparing for other companies when the second list was released. My name was amongst the 12 students
shortlisted in this second list.<br>
2. Interview: The second round was the interview round. The interviewer was a young cool guy who
brilliantly lessened the nervousness attached with the room. Placing his hands on my
shoulders asked me â€œ Aur Ajit, Kaisa Hai??â€. The first formal question was to describe myself to which
everyone has his own answer prepared and I had mine. He asked me my hobbies, I told him about my
interests in cricket and volleyball to which he asked me from which position I play in volleyball (since he
also kept an interest in the game). He asked for more, I told him I write poems and was impressed when I
recited him one on his demand. Next I told him that I also love doing guesstimate problems to which he
placed a question â€œestimate how many people use food courts in Howrah station for their meal.â€. He was
impressed with answer I gave, the way I proceeded and like this the interview round was clear. He also
asked a question on conditional probability which I found easy.
Advice for Interview:<br>
Practice puzzles, reasoning questions and probability (covered in reasoning part). Communication skills
should be perfect because thatâ€™s what one has to do in a consultancy firm. It is not necessary that you donâ€™t
have a chance if a few questions are unanswered. Keep your confidence high.<br>
3. HR Round: The HR was impressed with my CV especially my GPA, asked me why with such a good
GPA Iâ€™m not aiming for Core, if selected what is the guarantee that I wonâ€™t go for higher studies or MBA
or GATE. Basically one has to assure them that you are genuinely interested in working in their company.
Advice for HR: Tell them the things they want to listen, there will be instances where they would try to put you against your previous statements, so be clever.
Future Profile: For a start EXL services is good but will be open to switching jobs as better opportunities
