training in Industrial automation which was mentioned on my resume, then they asked
me about which PLC i have worked on, after that they asked me about some basic
concepts in machine like DOL STARTER, bucholz relay. Since my resume was full of
POWER ELECTRONICS based projects ,they asked thoroughly about it and lastly there
some questions from HR side like what are your greatest achievement till now, tell me
about PEAC and your role in it.<br><br><br>
<b>What is the importance of CGPA in placements?</b><br><br>

concepts which are pivotal in core jobs. In consultancies it doesn’t matter much, above

be great example of skills i mentioned earlier<br><br><br>

Soft skills are important. You need to be fluent in speaking english and should not
stammer, your body language does matter and being there for the interview on time also
makes a difference. Apart from that general knowledge questions might be asked.
