<p><strong>Q) Were AIEEE ranks effective in the interview?</strong><br>
A) Companies those shortlist the CVs may consider your AIEEE ranks, other companies don't
bother asking.<br>
<strong>Q) Do backlogs affect in placement in anyway? If yes, up to what extent.</strong><br>
A) Most companies have their own personal policies. Most companies would ask you whether
you have any existing backlogs or not. If you had backlogs in your past and you have cleared
those, they don't mind, you can sit for their rounds. But some companies have very strict policies
that you should not have any existing or cleared backlogs, otherwise they will not allow you to sit
for those companies. Very few companies, but most reputed companies, have those policies.<br>
<strong>Q) What is the average CGPA expected by a reputed company?</strong><br>
A) Most companies would go for 7.5, 7.5 is the highest they will ask you. Some companies have
an 8, but those are CS companies generally. Some companies might go for 6.5 for the first round
only. 7.5 would be a safe score to say. CGPA will not bother after you have cleared your first
round. If you are having a high CGPA, then it's a good point to show it but you must have that
much high CGPA to show. Otherwise try not showing it on your CV, show it but don't highlight it.
Always be prepared to answer the question that why do you have such a low CGPA.<br>
<strong>Q) What is the effectiveness of club activities and participation?</strong><br>
A) Club activities and participation would be considered in your last round i.e. interview according
to the relevance it has to the company's job profile and the fact that how you are being able to
show the relevance of your participation in the club activities to that particular company. I know a
lot of people who had totally irrelevant club activities and participation but they have shown the
relevance between the two, and the company got convinced. It's all about convincing the
company. If you can't convince a company even on a very positive thing then there's no scope
for you.<br>
<strong>Q) How to make a preference among different job platforms and scope of each?</strong><br>
A) Most important would be your own personal aptitude. If you have been good at core jobs i.e.
that lab works, getting nice high score, you understand the subjects very well and you have that
passion to work in an industrial environment, because naturally the industrial company pay a little
higher than the consultancies unless and until you are in a very good consultancy. The industries
generally has better future prospects, has better stability because it is the production sector
which is the most able sector right now. The service sector keeps getting the jolt of recession and
all. Second of all, of course the money matters. You should have in mind that some companies
pay more and some pay less. Don't wait for the companies which come at the end however good
it is, because you don't know whether they will select you or not. Keep a lot of backup plans,
keep two or three companies in your mind. Talk to your seniors those who are placed in those
companies.<br>
<strong>Q) What are the different rounds during placements?</strong><br>
A) Depending upon the companies job profile they would take a written might be on aptitude,
core knowledge, then there is a GD round, then there might be a personal interview round- it
might be a telephonic interview or a Skype interview, there might be a case study instead of a
GD. These are the general rounds for EEE. Apart from these for CS, ITs there are several coding
rounds.<br>
<strong>Q) How to make your resume impressive? Most importantly about do's and don'ts.</strong><br>
A) Most important thing about making a resume is putting in only relevant and defendable
information. If you put in any information which you can't defend over there and you know you
might get tangled into it i.e. if you don't have a 100% confidence in the particular detail no matter
how much time, money & effort you have put into that particular training, internship or whatever,
don't put it into your resume because that might create a problem in your PI. You are supposed 
to be prepared for what you are having in your resume and your resume supposed to reflect your
strength not your weaknesses.<br>
<strong>Q) What were the different standout questions during the interview and what were your
responses?</strong><br>
A) One of the question that I was asked was why is your CGPA so low. That question came after
a round of questions on the core subjects of which I answered about 70-80% and that is why this
question (â€œWhy is your CGPA is low? â€œ) was asked. My CGPA was around 7.7 and this company
do not recruit person with this CGPA. I quoted that my previous academic record was one of the
best during 10th and 12th, my college performance was not that good because I was involved in
the club activities. Whenever they throw a difficult question at you, you are not supposed to
panic. You are supposed to respond positively. You can say like, "itna sab kuch karenge to
CGPA kam hoga na sir". You are not supposed to say that Iâ€™m so sorry, I didn't prepare for these
well. If you have not done that much work, you can still quote it. Though that is not advisable but
you may say some stuff.<br>
<strong>Q) Further studies involvement?</strong><br>
A) Don't try to hide your intentions or to reveal your intentions too openly. Some companies will
think that he will leave after two years he has to study further and some companies would think
that you don't have any other ambitions, our company is enough for you. So you have to be
prepared about what companies expects you to answer i.e. do they want you to be honest or do
they want you to be smart. Even if you have to say that you want to study further make it in a
funny way like yes I have to study but I don't have money right now, you people will give me the
money, but I will remain faithful for the days I will be working in your company. But it's always
better to say that right now I don't have any such plans, eventually may be far into the future,
right now job is my focus.<br>
<strong>Q) What is the best way to get prepared for the interviews?</strong><br>
A) The best way to get prepared for the interviews is to have mock interviews. Because some
people have the lack of talking with people directly, they might be good in studies and everything
else, so you can prepare by speaking in front of a mirror like a mad person but that actually
helps. The telephonic interviews might be a challenge because the other person cannot see your
body language as if you are talking to a person your body language actually helps but in a
telephonic conversation all that matters is your voice modulation. So talk slowly about the things
you want to stress. You need to know beforehand that what type of interview it is whether it is a
core or HR or general and get prepared in that way.<br>
<strong>Q) Which one to prefer ? Training or Internship?</strong><br>
A) At the end of first or second year, even before 5th semester whatever you want to do is onto
you. If you get paid internship, which is actually rare, that might be of help. At the end of 3rd year,
try not to have any training because it's the time to study for the companies. Take the internships
only if they provide a PPO attached to it and you are having a high chance of getting the PPO.
Otherwise don't waste these summer vacations because those are the very precious 2 months of
your life and you can prepare well as the companies start coming just after the end of summer
vacations.<br>
<strong>Q) Any advice to your juniors.?</strong><br>
A) You should know beforehand that what you want from life. If you are in a club try to be on the
top of the club, don't be the person who are always busy in doing stuffs like taking permissions or
working the whole day. In 1st and 2nd year you have to work in the clubs under the seniors, but
try to be at a good rank in your 3rd or 4th year. But if you are working like earlier even in your 3rd
or 4th year, then it's better to leave that club. Be in any club for yourself not for the club because
you have to improve upon your personality. Try to build your CV, if the work you are doing
doesn't reflect in your CV or doesn't improve your personality then there's no point in doing it
anyways.<br>
