<p><b>Tell us about your college life? How has BIT affected you as a person?</b><br><br>
My college life has been quite fascinating, I didn’t had much exposure to the outside
world, and so as I came here I got a knack of many things. The first year was a bit
strenuous for me, I couldn&#39;t assimilate the fact that I am in BIT Mesra. I used to be in my
own lot of friends. So the first year went in a haste and I felt that college grades are not as
imperative as gaining the required adroitness to be an electrical engineer. I was then
acquainted with MATLAB through a workshop conducted by Robolution in association
with Technophilia and I became quite intrigued in MATLAB, particularly in digital image
processing. Then my work experience, involvement in EEESOC helped me to become
what I am.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the company in which you have been placed.</b><br><br>
I got placed in Tata Steel. It is a pre-placement offer which I received after an internship
there through the campus selection that we had. It&#39;s quite an amicable company and one
can say that it is some kind of a pseudo government job. They have a very amiable
working culture where everyone is at par when it comes to work, be it an intern or a
chief. For instance, if you have an advisement concerning a technical issue, they will
definitely hearken.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the selection procedure at that company?</b><br><br>
I was first selected as an intern. The duration of the internship was two months. The
process here for selection of an intern consisted of three rounds, the first one was a
written round, then the group discussion stage and then finally the technical interview.
The written test inhered aptitude, technical and logical reasoning section, usually
technical section is given more weightage. I scored 100 percentile in the technical
section. The questions in technical section were quite random, they ranged from
Machines, EEGC, Instrumentation and Power systems.<br><br><br>
<b>How important is CGPA a factor in placement?</b><br><br>
CGPA apprise how good you are as a student, a paradigm of how well you used to
perform on paper, so having a good CGPA reflects that you were quite disciplined about
your studies and you gave importance to them. On the contrary if you have a mediocre
GPA it means that you have given your time to do something else and if that something
else is related to some skillset helpful in placements then you may have an advantage or
else you certainly are at loss. To ensure cutoff’s of most companies, CGPA 7.5 and above
can be considered good.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the projects that you did? How did they help your placement?
What are the internships that you undertook? How important are they a
factor in deciding placement?</b><br><br>

I used to learn about MATLAB from the mathworks, other tutorials. So, in my first year I
designed many apps and plots using MATLAB. Owing to my interest in DIP/CV, I
gradually worked on projects (Solid Surface defects detection &amp; classification, etc.). After
that I did an internship in Delhi at UVSoft Technologies, where I did two projects, one
was face detection in surveillance videos and the other was Hand gesture recognition
based robot motion control. After that I got selected for a work from home internship at
Robokraft Technologies (a startup) through internshala. During that I worked on a
project related to computer vision based warehouse automation and it gave me a
considerable edge when I appeared for Tata Steel.<br><br><br>
<b>Do club activities in general impact placement?</b><br><br>
One thing which is earnest during interview is the demeanor that you have, as well as
your disposition towards the interview. These things don’t come to you impromptu, and
so club activities do help you to become versed with these things.<br><br><br>
<b>What does it take for an EEE undergrad to be placed in software/coding
based company?</b><br><br>
Our curriculum allows us to explore many options, as we had C and data structures
courses common for all in first year. So anybody who realizes that he/she has his/her
interests in coding and software based sphere by third semester, has to start learning OS,
DBMS and other relevant courses of their interest on his/her own. ACM contests,
NPTEL, coursera videos &amp; other online sources are best utilized by such students. We
have DC to help in this regard.<br><br><br>
<b>What topics are generally given for Group Discussions in interviews?</b><br><br>
It depends on company to company but usually group discussion is done on socio-
political issues or if it is technical company they might give you a technical case study.
For a few companies,being decisive in arguments is a needed skill. They would give a
squabbling topic and ask a group to assert among themselves and come to a unanimous
decision.<br><br><br>
<b>Say one has published a technical paper. Does it have tangible benefits when
it comes to placements?</b><br><br>
It depends on the company you applied for and job profile they offer. Showing papers in
resume for irrelevant companies/profiles will only backfire. Most of the companies that
offer profiles like R&amp;D or that demand quality skillset &amp; good experience, boast about
their intellectual property. A relevant research paper / patent for such will give you an
edge and boost chances of acceptance.<br><br>
<b>THANK YOU</p>
