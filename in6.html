<p><strong>Q)ABOUT MUSIGMA:</strong><br>
The job in Mu Sigma basically deals with solving some business problems based on statistical
analysis using various programming tools like R, SAS and SPSS. After proposing a proper
solution, a presentation has to be made and given to clients. The clients in general include
pharma, insurance and banking. The company has a pre-defined pay scale starting with 4.5 lpa
with a growth of 20-25% every year making it 18 lacs in three years. The only thing that I feel the
company lacks in is it's pay scale. In the three years of my service I will not be given any
performance appraisal fixing the salary to 21 lacs in three years if all bonuses are included.<br>
<strong>Q)TRAINING AND PROJECTS:</strong><br>
 II YEAR: A project in electrical and electronics.<br>
 III YEAR TRAINING: Two branch related projects in my third year.<br>
I had also done a course in R, a data analytics programming tool, which got me an edge over
others for a job in Mu Sigma.<br>
Q) SUMMER Training:<br> PLC & SCADA from a training institute in Jamshedpur. I would personally
suggest it for all those who are interested for a job in a core company of electrical.<br>
<strong>Q)Any suggestion:</strong><br>
Start with minor projects, honestly devote proper time for it and having got the basics cleared go
for a major project under a professorâ€™s guidance.<br>
<strong>Q)BASIC REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY FOR MU SIGMA:</strong><br>
Any student with no current backlog makes him/her eligible for placement in the company. There
is no CGPA barrier as such.<br>
<strong>Q)ROLE OF CLUB ACTIVITIES IN PLACEMENT:</strong> In oneâ€™s resume, there is hardly a role of being a
member of a club, but being in a club definitely improves your communication skills, confidence
and the way you present yourself in a group. I was in EEESOC wherein I learnt management
skills. In my II year I had organised events in PANTHEON and then organising workshops helped
me gain experience in the management area.<br>
<strong>ROUNDS INVOLVED:</strong><br>
Around 750 students appeared for the first round from our college. There were three rounds
involved in the placement procedure of the company:<br>
 Q)WRITTEN:<br> This included four sections:<br>
1. CREATIVE thinking: Images were given and we had to interpret what the image conveyed. In
my case there were two questions in the creative section. The first was a flock of birds flying in a
V pattern and the second question was the image of a rhinoceros on a treadmill with a Unicorn
beside.<br>
2. Quant<br>
3. Logical reasoning<br>
4. English<br>
After the written 72 students were shortlisted.<br>
Q) GROUP DISCUSSION:<br> Topics were like why Mu Sigma why not! After the group discussion 45
students were shortlisted.<br>
Q)PERSONAL INTERVIEW:<br> In a span of 5 minutes they canâ€™t judge a person. They mostly were
interested in knowing whether I would be able to handle their clients properly or not, my
confidence and how honest I was with my resume. Seeing my activities in the resume the
interviewer questioned me on various points as to how the things were done.<br>
<strong>Q)HOW TO WRITE A GOOD RESUME:</strong><br> Donâ€™t mention the very common things like Microsoft word,
excel and different tools individually instead Microsoft office would do. A good resume should not
exceed two pages keeping it short and precise would be a plus point. Make a resume that is
company oriented. Place those points first on which you want the company to ask questions. A
technical related company would like technical points while others may like to see more of extra-
curricular activities. Go through the job description and alter the resume accordingly. Also make
sure to put those lines in bold on which you want the reader to give a special attention.<br>
<strong>Q)ABOUT OFF CAMPUS PLACEMENT: </strong><br>Most of the off campus placements that I have seen
people apply for, is in the line of data analytics and electronics. If your resume is selected, you
are given assignments in stages, proper completion of which makes you eligible for the job after
an HR and a technical interview.<br>
<strong>Q)FUTURE PROFILE:</strong><br> For now, I wish to experience my job in Mu Sigma and of course the life in
Bangalore, where I am placed. For future, I may probably go for a management degree or an
MBA, have an interest in psychology as well, havenâ€™t decided yet. At present Mu Sigma it is.<br>
