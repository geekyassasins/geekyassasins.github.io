<p>Tell us something about your college life. How has BIT affected your
personality?</b><br><br>
First year was quite a hectic. I used to think that in college there will be fewer classes, but
it was not like that. I didn’t have a good GPA, in first semester my GPA was 7.5 and in
second semester it was 7.66. I took part in Pantheon, enjoyed very much. In first year I
was an introvert, but I realized that you have to communicate with people, it gives u a
chance to enhance your personality.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the company in which you have been placed. Are you planning
to take up the offer or you planning to study more?</b><br><br>
I am placed in PWC (PricewaterhouseCoopers). It is a company of technical consulting
and auditing. I am taking the offer. Higher studies, not in near future.<br><br><br>

<b>Tell us about the placement process at the company.</b><br><br>
The first step was an aptitude test along with verbal ability, some questions are easy,
some questions are tough. You have to be good in English to crack PWC written test.
After that, there were two rounds – HR round and technical round. Technical people
have to go for technical round and HR people have to go for HR round. I was selected for
technical, in the interview they asked questions based on my resume. I have done
projects on VSI (Voltage Source Inverter), closed loop and motors. So they asked me
about my projects. You have to convince the company that you are the right candidate
for the job. The first question that the interviewer asked me was that - you did projects so
why are you not going for higher studies, why PWC. I told him that from the first year I
used to think that if I have to get a good placement then I have to do projects, so I did my
projects for my placements. I also told him that if I have to go for higher studies, then I
would have written journal papers, conference papers but I don’t have any such papers.
Then they were convinced, they asked me some technical questions to make sure that I
was not lying. The final round was telephonic round with the HR that round was a bit
hectic and you need to be fluent in your answers and specific. You have to explain in just
two to three minutes about yourself you don’t need to elaborate.<br><br><br>
<b>How many campus interviews can one sit?</b><br><br>
In BIT the companies are divided into levels. Level A companies are dream companies,
level B companies give package around 6-8 lakhs and level C are mass recruiting
companies. If you are selected for level C Company then you can sit for level B and level
A company. If you are selected for the dream company you can’t sit for any other
company. If you are selected for level B Company then you can’t sit for any other level B
company.<br><br><br>
<b>How important is the CGPA factor in placement?</b><br><br>
CGPA is basically a rejection criterion. If you have CGPA over 7.5 then you can sit for
almost every company. I will say for higher studies, CAT, GRE and off campus,
placements it is better to maintain CGPA 8 or above.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the projects and internships that you undertook?</b><br><br>
I did quite a lot of projects based on electrical and embedded systems. In the first year I
did projects related to embedded systems and in the second year I did projects on power
electronics (VSI, choppers, motor drives). Projects are very important to have a good
resume because the interviewer wants to see a special thing in you. He will ask from that,
this will narrow your area of questions. But even if you don’t have projects there is
nothing to worry about just keep your concepts clear. The four most important subjects
are power systems, DSP, machines and power electronics.<br><br><br>
<b>Were you a part of any club or team? And how did it impact your placement?</b><br><br>
I am part of EEESOC, Team Avion and Team PEAC. Club activities did not help me in
my interviews because they asked me only about my projects. But sometimes it helps
because they can ask what you did other than your academics, then at that time you can
say that I have leadership quality, which you can justify by your Post in any club or team.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the internships that you undertook?</b><br><br>

I haven’t done any internship. Basically, in an internship, you do projects which help
you. For internships, you can look for internshala, startups and also in IITs.<br><br><br>
<b>What are the technical skills (like embedded systems, PLC SCADA, coding
etc.) that may give one a technical edge over other?</b><br><br>
The technical skills which can give you an edge over others are the recent technologies.
Not many companies related to embedded systems visits our campus, but if you do
machine learning then it will be very helpful. Try to gain knowledge on recent
technology.<br><br><br>
<b>How many core companies generally visits BIT?</b><br><br>
Core companies visiting BIT are very few compared to the financial and auditing
companies. This year 8- 10 came, the number can vary because some companies visit
alternate year.<br><br><br>
<b>What does it take for an EEE undergraduate to be placed in a coding based
company?</b><br><br>
Generally, the coding companies do not allow EEE students. But if in your class 10-15
students are interested in coding then you can request the TNP to allow EEE for coding
companies.<br><br><br>
<b>What are the soft skills (like communication, body language, general
knowledge etc.) that matter in interviews?</b><br><br>
They don’t ask for general knowledge but communication and body language play a key
role. You have to be fluent in English and quick in your answers. You should think and
then answer.<br><br><br>
<b>What are the topics that are generally given for Group Discussion in
interviews? Some tips about Group Discussions.</b><br><br>
I haven’t given any group discussion. But many of my friends gave it, they generally give
topics on current affairs. You should practice for group discussions from third year
onwards.<br><br><br>
<b>How does publishing a technical paper benefit one when it comes to
placement?</b><br><br>
It doesn’t give you a benefit because they will think that you will go for higher studies
and you will leave the company. If you have published technical papers and the company
is not recruiting for a technical profile then don’t show it. If you are showing it, then
assure to the company that you will not leave it.<br><br><br>
<b>Any general advice to juniors. Your final thoughts and suggestions.</b><br><br>
First advice is that EEE is a very good branch and it has a wide range of research as well
as the scope for a core so be confident. Second advice is that maintain the CGPA. If you
have to prepare for GATE and CAT, then you have very good time in the 8th semester
because there will be no classes at that time.<br><br><br>
