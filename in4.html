<p><strong>1. Would you please tell us about the selection process of the Grey Orange.</strong><br>
ANS. Firstly, there was an online test on hacker earth, mostly about embedded systems. There
were questions on microprocessors<br>
(Both 8085 and 8086). There were MCQ questions and a few subjective questions. Then was the
coding round, checking your fluency in c. Then after qualifying this, at midnight there was a pen
and paper round where we were given a long problem statement about a machine and its
specifications and its operations and was supposed to write a code. Then after qualifying this,
around 1 week later there was the interview.<br>
<strong>2. What was the standout question asked to you in the interview?<strong><br>
ANS. I was asked that as I have done work and both embedded and image processing, so what
was my first priority. I have liked both of them equally. I had started working recently on image
processing and used to work on embedded. So I said image processing. First they asked about
my Robocon project. Then a few questions on c, one of which was on linked list. Then I was
asked how to store an image, assuming that u do not have open cv or MATLAB. After that I was
given a problem statement that I have an A4 sheet with a number of squares and other shapes
drawn and I had to detect the squares. Also the sheet was not directly under the camera. The
questions were difficult, but they were checking the approach. Basically they were checking my
experience in open cv.<br>
<strong>3. How do you give weightage to experience in open cv or MATLAB in your resume, like if you
have a MATLAB project then how does it weigh for them?</strong><br>
ANS. It depends on kind of your project. If itâ€™s an awesome project covering everything, it will
carry significant weightage. But many startups value the experience in open source. Itâ€™s good
that you have experience in MATLAB but you should also some knowledge about open source.<br>
<strong>4. How was your approach for all this in coming years?</strong><br>
ANS. Actually I had been unconsciously preparing for Grey Orange for the last 3 years. So there
questions exactly fitted my capabilities, so no special preparation was required, just had to be
myself. There were some topics that I hadnâ€™t covered, like experience in Linux, so itâ€™s good to
have experience in that.<br>
For Grey Orange you should have 1 project that is fairly complex covering all the peripherals. My
approach was very simple, I just had to be thorough with whatever I had done.<br>
<strong>5. How much weightage do the projects have in the interview, like do more number of projects
reduces the number of questions asked in the interview?</strong><br>
ANS. See, the projects cover around 70-80% time of interview. If you have 1 very good and
exhaustive project that interests them, it will very good. It doesnâ€™t matter from where you have
done the project. They donâ€™t ask form where you have done, they give focus on what you have
done.<br>
<strong>6. What are your comments on CGPA?</strong><br>
ANS. My job is not from core electrical but more inclined towards electronics and computer
science. For core branches it is very important to maintain the CGPA.<br>
<strong>7. Is there any cut-off?</strong><br>
ANS. 7.5 should be good. Actually it is the minimum that is required.<br>
<strong>8. In these 4 years, are the club activities helpful?</strong><br>
ANS. They donâ€™t ask about the club activities. So if you do work
Outside the club or inside the club, it doesnâ€™t matter as far as technical clubs are concerned. If itâ€™s
a managerial club they might ask about what kind of organizing skills you have done. Grey
Orange doesnâ€™t value that.<br>
<strong>9. You must be having managing skills like you have managed a team, will you please share
your experience?</strong><br>
ANS. Actually I was a computer vision head in 3rd year. Yes I had managed a small sub-team.
There were many sub-teams that take care of different technical aspects. I led a small sub-team
that did the image processing, so it was more of a technical management.<br>
<strong>10. What would be your future perspective for people of your domain (specifically image
processing)?</strong><br>
ANS. Image processing is still a novel thing in India. Not many
Companies are working on it. But itâ€™s a luxury, as it solves many tasks which are usually
expensive when you use embedded systems. So I would suggest you should do a complex
project. It shouldnâ€™t stay on laptop, it should interact with some kind of hardware. Use of open
source is preferred.<br>
Matlab is also very powerful, as in case of heavy machine learning task, so use of MATLAB is
justified. Companies which come here test 4 skills- communication skills, analytical skills, coding
skills and core skills. If your first and any of the last of these skills are good, then you will surely
end up getting a good job. You might be heartbroken because of many rejections. The key is in
keeping cool at times of hardships.<br>
<strong>11. What are the microprocessors on which we need to have an extensive hands on experience?</strong><br>
ANS. For the companies which come under embedded systems, there is a need to have an
extensive hand on experience. In the 1st year I started working on Arduino, which was sufficient.
In the 2nd year I started working on atmega16 and implemented all the peripherals. Then after
implementing that you think of a project that combines all the peripherals. In this way you will get
an in-depth knowledge of the microcontroller. In the beginning of 3rd year, Robocon started.
In the wake of Robocon I started working on MATLAB and the to open cv and got a major boost.
If you are going for real time computer vision then open cv should be very helpful else MATLAB
is good like a complex image processing task. It is important to keep moving. I moved on to TSI
and then after placements I worked on raspberry pi and Odroid XU4. My entire Robocon this
year was based on image processing.<br>
<strong>12. What are the basic microcontrollers that would expect to us know? Will they be particular
about any microcontroller?</strong><br>
ANS. They will ask you about the microcontroller you are comfortable with. They will test your
basic knowledge and if you have to move to other platform, then are you clear with your basics. If
you are comfortable with any of them, then itâ€™s good.<br>
<strong>13. What would you be doing after engineering if you didnâ€™t get a placement?</strong><br>
ANS. I would apply for off campus. I would prefer startup first and then in corporate one. I would
work in a startup for 2-3 years and then would move to a bigger company. For now my plans are
sticking to Grey Orange, for gaining some experience for 5-6 years, either move up in the
hierarchy or separating from it and then starting a company by whatever I would have learnt in
Grey Orange.<br>
<strong>14. You had worked on many complex projects, didnâ€™t you ever had a thought of having a
research paper? What is the scope for research work on a project?</strong><br>
ANS. If you are doing a research project, then be assured that itâ€™s going to be complex. You have
to put your algorithm through various benchmarks and then only itâ€™s going to be accepted as a
research paper. If you doing a research paper then make sure that itâ€™s good enough to be
presented in the interview. But itâ€™s advisable not to put your research paper in your resume.
Having a paper is useful special when you are applying for Freescale. They only fear that if you
have too many research papers then you might leave for exams like GRE. Having a research
paper is not mandatory, all that matters is what technical work you have done in these 4 years.<br>
