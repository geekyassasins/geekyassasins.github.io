<p><b>Tell us something about your college life. How has BIT affected your
personality?</b><br><br>
BIT has changed me a lot. Earlier I was an introvert. I did not sit on the first bench, I
feared to talk to girls. But now I can freely speak in front of everyone. I used to be an
introvert in the first year but gradually I started enjoying with my friends and have now
become an outgoing person. I have experienced positive changes in me. Academics
remain the same but what has changed is that I have opened myself up to others.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the company in which you have been placed in.</b><br><br>
I wanted to get placed in a core company and fortunately did get placed in two of them. I
couldn’t clear the first rounds of the companies that visited earlier. So that was a bit
depressing. But later on, when L&amp;T and Vedanta came, both my interviews went well
and I got selected in both the companies.<br><br><br>
<b>Tell us about the placement process at the company.</b><br><br>
For L&amp;T: It takes a written aptitude test but it was different from the written test of other
companies. It was more of a psychological and English language test. Other companies
take technical tests. The aptitude questions in all the other companies are more or less
the same. I cleared that written exam pretty well. Then there was the interview round.
First, they asked me to introduce myself and then there were a series of technical
questions. They asked me about Power Systems, Machines, Power Electronics, etc. I was
asked about 10-15 technical questions. My interview went on for 45 minutes. The
interviewer seemed to be quite impressed by me and I also had a sense of satisfaction
from within.<br><br><br>
<b>Do you think it is important to answer all of those questions or is it
important that one tries?</b><br><br>
See, L&amp;T is a Construction Company so I knew they would ask me questions related to
the construction domain like Power Systems. I knew they would ask me something
related to their projects because the HR will ask questions only of the domain he knows.
They asked me about Power Systems and went on to structures. I had searched about the
company’s projects so that I could answer the questions put forth. But I would
recommend that if one does not know the answer then you should straightaway say that
to the interviewer. If one does not know the in-depth knowledge of something then he
shouldn’t answer as they go deeper into the topic. Same did happen with me, they went
deeper into the topic but fortunately, I answered them all.<br><br><br>
<b>How important is CGPA a factor in placement?</b><br><br>
CGPA is an important factor and if one has a CGPA above 7.5, he can sit for the
interviews of most of the companies. It is a key factor and I recommend having a CGPA
above 7.5. If it’s above 8 then it is even more beneficial but CGPA above 9 might backfire.
The HR may ask you that why are you so much into academics and there is a chance for

rejection as they would think that you might go for research and leave the company in
the future. But in the end it is good to have a nice CGPA. Companies like KPMG
shortlists candidates based on their CGPA so you need to keep your CGPA higher if you
want to get placed in these companies.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the projects that you did?</b><br><br>
I did two projects. I worked on MPPT i.e., Maximum Power Point Tracking of a solar
panel. It includes modelling of a solar panel and then finding the maximum power point.
It includes an algorithm for that purpose. After finding the maximum power point it lets
you step up or down the voltage according to your purpose. The other project was on
Magnetic Levitation. So I had designed a PRD controller for that purpose.<br><br><br>
<b>How did the projects affect your placement?</b><br><br>
Projects are beneficial but in my interviews, I was not asked about my projects. They
didn’t even see my resume. But they are beneficial because if you are not being able to
answer the questions then the interviewers ask you about your resume and your projects.
So one must be well versed with whatever he writes in his resume.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the clubs you were a part of? Did they impact your placement?</b><br><br>
Clubs have a great impact on our all-round development. It is due to the clubs only that I
have become an extrovert. So do join some club, either cultural or technical as per your
interest. I joined IETE in my first year and later on joined Team Aveon Racing. It
enhances your management skills, makes you confident in speaking in front of people,
how to get permissions; indulge in some financial work etc. So these things help you in
some way or the other.<br><br><br>
<b>What were the internships that you undertook?</b><br><br>
I did not do any internship as such but was a part of ‘Internshala’ for 8-10 months. So
that was a work from home internship and I learnt a lot about sharing internships on
Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. I made the page ‘Internshala BIT Mesra’ and am the
admin of that page. So I was a link to bring the internships from Internshala to BIT. So
this is one of the marketing internships I did. Also, I did 1 or 2 industrial trainings,
through which I got the knowledge of how things happen in industries.<br><br><br>
<b>Questions from which subjects were asked the most during the interview
process?</b><br><br>
For core companies Machines, Power Systems and Power Electronics are very important.
DSP is not that important. In the consulting domain, there is no such subject that is
important. One should be good in Mathematics and with puzzles.<br><br><br>
<b>What are the soft skills (like communication skills, body language etc.) that
matter in interviews?</b><br><br>
Yes, they do matter especially in Group Discussions. In a GD you should sit properly, you
shouldn’t be very loud; neither should your volume be very low. Also during the
interview, you should be friendly with the interviewer. Don’t get nervous during your
interview. Practice giving answers to the questions that are frequently asked in
interviews.<br><br><br>

<b>What topics are generally given for Group Discussions in interviews?</b><br><br>
I sat in the Group Discussion for two companies. For KPMG, the topic was that “If the
world is going to end today, what would be the five things you would like to take with
you?”. In Vedanta, the topic was “Are the advertisements of today good or bad for the
future?”<br><br><br>
<b>What are the technical skills (like embedded systems, PLC SCADA etc.) that
gave you a technical edge over others?</b><br><br>
The core companies do not ask such things unless the company is working or doing a
research on that field. It is quite rare that companies ask you questions on such topics.
But these topics are very important if they are working on them. I didn’t work on these
topics but if one does, it’s good for his resume and his experience because the future
depends on these things. In my case, it didn’t affect either of the placements.<br><br><br>
<b>Any cherished memories that you will take with you when you leave the
institute?</b><br><br>
There have been many memories. Even in a single room, you enjoy talking to your
friends endlessly, beating one another etc. We have gone for night-outs. I would say you
should go out and enjoy partying with your friends. It will give you a feeling of happiness
and belongingness. So you should be an all-rounder.
In both of the placements, they asked me about my hobbies. So when I told them about
beat boxing, they inquired about it as they did not know what it is. So I did beat boxing at
that moment and they were quite happy and impressed with that.<br><br><br>
<b>Any general advice to juniors?</b><br><br>
Do what you like; go with your interests rather than going too much into technical or
studying stuff. If you do something you are interested in, you will achieve success at
some point in your life. It will help you in your placement. Like in both my interviews I
was made to do beat boxing. So things like music, painting do help in some way or the
other. Don’t go too much into studies for getting placed. These are important but you
should do what you are interested in and you will definitely enjoy doing it.<br>
THANK YOU</p>
