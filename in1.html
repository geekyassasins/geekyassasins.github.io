<p><strong>Q) Would you please tell us about the club activities you took part in?</strong><br>
A) I am a member in Team Avion, which is going to be a club and also was a part of IET but I
didn't participate much. I did participate in Student mentorship programme which held some
types of competitions, this was in my 2nd year. In my 3rd year, a project on 4-quadrant chopper
and closed loop dc motor during summer vacation.<br>
<strong>Q) What were your participations in management side?</strong><br>
A) Initially, I was inclined more towards the technical stuff and did not concentrate on
management. The only thing I can recollect doing is when I was the reading room in charge in
my hostel. Usually people donâ€™t take these kinds of job seriously but I did. I did analyse things
like cost reduction, selecting required magazines etc. I would say that no role is small, you can
always make the most of it.<br>
<strong>Q) I see that you more of a technical kind of person, what consequences made you shift lane?</strong><br>
A) Yeah, I am a technical person, in 5th semester I aimed for getting into TATA STEEL. I did
prepare for those exams by consulting seniors, but I wasnâ€™t sure of the level of aptitude questions
they were going to ask. I was ready with my technical knowledge and didnâ€™t concentrate much
towards my English and aptitude. Consequently, I was rejected in the group discussions i.e 2nd
round of the selection procedure and this made me realize I was not at all ready for things like
this, I need to work hard in this area. This is when I decided that I would mould myself in such a
way what so ever the company may be, I must be ready for it.<br>
<strong>Q) Please tell us the steps you took to become what you are today.</strong><br>
A) I began reading the news because it is advantageous to use factual data in group discussion.
Being reading room in charge help me a lot. I also took responsibility for management work in
Team Avion. And coming to preparation part, Logical reasoning and aptitude are a must for most
of the companies. I prepared from Arun Sharma. There are 3 levels in it, 1st being lower difficulty
and 3rd of a higher standard. Companies who require technical students do not go beyond level
two whereas consulting and others ask from level three. A topic called syllogism is very important
and even blood relations, number theory. I suggest indiabix.com for logical questions
and electical4u.com for technical. However, for this job, there was directly Personal interview, but
preparing all these helped me a lot.<br>
<strong>Q) How did you prepare for group discussions.</strong><br>
A) TnP holds workshops for those and please attend them, they are a lot beneficial. Factual data
helps a lot. Companies see how you present your thoughts and convey them.
Q) How to answer â€™Tell me about yourself?â€™
A) You have to answer this question in such a way as if you are selling yourself to the company.
Tell about things which you are all about and not a part of your resume. Suppose you say you
are adaptive, you must present an example proving that, say you are hardworking then state an
example. It must be like a story presentation about your past experiences etc., and you must
provide all your selling points about yourself.<br>
<strong>Q) How did you answer this question?</strong><br>
A) After my basic introduction, I said catchy points like I am consistent, hardworking, it is not
always about the money but also about learning.<br>
<strong>Q) Does backlogs matter?</strong><br>
A) CGPA helps a lot, elimination initially is done on this basis, My CGPA is above 8. From this,
they learnt that that I am hard working. Even the other person who got this job has CGPA above
8. Backlogs do not matter much as long as they are cleared.<br>
<strong>Q) Any further studies plans?</strong><br>
A) No, I do not but you must never mention them in placements, you might be rejected.<br>
Thank you, Gaurav bhaiya for your time and thoughts.<br></p>
