<p><strong>1.Tell us something about different types of companies coming to BIT for placements and the company
you are placed in.</strong><br>
ANS. A lot many companies come to BIT including consultancy firms, core companies, marketing
companies. Number of core companies coming to BIT are comparatively less. KPMG is one of the Big
Four auditor companies. It provides audit, tax and advisory services.<br>
<strong>2. What must be the basis of selection of a company for a student?</strong><br>
ANS. First of all, a student must be clear about what he is aiming for. Whether he is good at technical or
management. For core companies, you must have a very good technical knowledge but if itâ€™s the case of
consultancy firms or management companies, technical knowledge is not that important.<br>
<strong>3. Tell us something about the difficulties you faced in your selection process.</strong><br>
ANS. Everyone is nervous during placements. It is quite obvious, but as one gives one or two interviews,
one becomes used to it. Especially in my case I was nervous but I used to listen to music before my
interviews to overcome nervousness.<br>
<strong>4. What were the different rounds in your selection process?</strong><br>
ANS. There were basically 3 rounds.<br>
The first one was a common entrance test out of which some 10 people were shortlisted.
The second round was Group discussion in 2 groups having 5 members each, out of which 4 people were
selected for PI round.<br>
Finally there was the PI round or the HR round where it is necessary that we must impress the HRs as
much as we can.<br>
<strong>5. Is this one of the companies you actually aimed for?</strong><br>
ANS. I actually aimed for some consultancy firm as I was not that good in technical.<br>
<strong>6. Tell us something about the role of club activities in your placement.</strong><br>
ANS. The role of club activities becomes important in enhancing your management skills. If you are a
leader of a club, it also enhances your leadership qualities. During the HR round, you may tell these points.<br>
<strong>7. Tell us something about the role of different projects and research papers.</strong><br>
ANS. Projects are important as you actually come to know about a topic in detail when you yourself have
worked on it. Projects enhance your knowledge and will give you an upper edge in your placements, but
you should have a complete knowledge of your project as you can be asked questions from it during the
placements.<br>
<strong>8. What is the importance of CGPA cut-off in placements?</strong><br>
ANS. CGPAs are important but not to a very great extent. During these 4 years one should try to have a
CGPA above 7 and maintain it. Many companies have a cut off CGPA of 7 for appearing in their entrance
tests. Some companies also have cutoff of 7.5. So one must always try to maintain his/her CGPA above
7.5. CGPA also give you an upper edge when there is a tie between two candidates of equal caliber.<br>
<strong>9. Do the backlogs have a negative impact in placements?</strong><br>
ANS. One should clear all the backlogs before the placement sessions. Some companies are there whose
criteria is no past backlogs. In order to avoid such rejections, one must avoid backlogs.<br>
<strong>10. What was your interview standout question?</strong><br>
ANS. During the interview you must always try to impress the HR. They asked me, â€œwhy do you want to
join KPMG?â€. I replied that it has a good name and if I would ever leave the company and join some other
company, I would say that I have come from KPMG. I would not say that I am coming from a x lakh
package job. The HRs were quite impressed by this answer.<br>
<strong>11. What are the skills required to get the placement.</strong><br>
ANS. One must improve his communication skills and his general aptitude. It helps a lot in clearing the
common entrance test where questions including reasoning based, puzzle solving, pattern recognition and
general ability will be asked.<br>
<strong>12. What do you think must be the time when a student should start thinking about their placement?</strong><br>
ANS. One must start preparing from the 3rd year summers onwards. You get a 2 months gap for preparing
yourself for the placements for revising topics you had forgotten and to brush up topics in your<br>
projects/research papers.
<strong>13. How to write an impressive resume?</strong><br>
ANS. A good resume must be of 1 page or a maximum of one and a half page long. It must include the
details of all your important achievements and projects. One should mention about the projects only if he
himself had done them and is well versed with it. Questions can be asked from those projects. Your
important works during these 4 years can be mentioned. You can also mention the posts you were
appointed in any of the clubs and the roles which you played.<br>
<strong>14. What is the advice you would you like to give to your juniors?</strong><br>
ANS. My only advice to the juniors is to learn, enjoy and live life. One must enjoy the college life but at
the same time one should not forget the purpose of them coming to the college.<br>
<strong>15. What are your plans for future studies?</strong><br>
ANS. There are no plans for higher studies in the near future.<br></p>
