<p><strong>Q) We would like to know about the club activities you took part in.</strong><br>
A) In first year I was there in almost 4 to 5 clubs, so after my 2nd year I had to choose which clubs I had to
get into. My main priorities were IET, IETE, NSS. So after 2nd year I was there in IETE and NSS (only if
I used to like the work I used to go in NSS). Then I got into TnP and then I gave the whole of my time to
TNP.<br>
<strong>Q) How these club activities help in your placement?</strong><br>
A) My personal experience says it helped 100% because I was a TNP coordinator. The interviewer of HR
department, Puja, I was the 1st person whom she met in BIT. She asked me about myself and my hobbies
etc. So we spoke a lot for about 15 to 20 minutes then I had to go for my written test of PWC. Then I was
shortlisted for the interview. Then I got into the room for my interview and surprisingly I saw her sitting
there and she was like, â€œHi Vineesha!!!â€. It was so damn chill, I was not feeling like I am giving an
interview, it was like a friendly talk. Then it goes very well and I got selected.<br>
<strong>Q) What were the steps you took to become what you are?</strong><br>
A) I got into BIT in electrical and I continued in this as I was not keen in any branch sliding. So I was
likeâ€¦ let's see what the electrical is and I liked the subject. In my 2nd year summer break I did my
internship at BHCL and it was really tiring. Then I was sure that I can't do technical any more. Then I
decided to get into management or consultancy or something like that because I realised that I love being
in clubs more than being technical. So in summers of 3rd year I didn't do any internship not even touched
electrical and was idle for 2 months, I was just solving aptitude, puzzles and stuffs like that. If you are
good at verbal and quantitative, everything is fine. If your communication skills are above par then it's
really easy to get into consultancy companies.<br.
<strong>Q) Which one is better-internship or industrial training?</strong><br>
A) Internship is better. If you have a proper project and if you are really interested in that particular area
then it's really better.<br>
<strong>Q) Does backlogs matter in the placement procedure?</strong><br>
A) Yes, absolutely. There should be no backlog because they are not even allowed. As I was a T&P
coordinator I know that sometimes they even told us that no backlogs are considered. That was some
criteria. I mean that you even have a backlog of first year which you have cleared, thatâ€™s not going to
matter. So it's better if you not to have a backlog as it's not hard to get a 5 or 6 grade.<br>
<strong>Q) Any writing tips for resume.</strong><br>
A) Resume should have proper format. It should be precise and add details about your extra-curricular
activities, academic achievements. It depends on which type of company you are applying like if you are
applying for a management company then your club activities should me more prioritised and if you are
doing for technical then add details about your projects. Just keep it short and simple. One and a half page
is more than enough.<br>
<strong>Q) Many companies ask 'why do you want to join us?â€™ How to answer this question?</strong><br>
A) Now even this will depend on the perspective which you see, depends on the company in which you are
applying for. Mainly you have to research for these things. First thing is that when a company is coming to
your college, go check there website, understand what they actually do and see what is there different in
that company from other ones.<br>
<strong>Q) How to answer â€™Tell me about yourself?â€™</strong><br>
A) You have to have one thing which is different from other. At least tell some hobby on which they can
show some interest. You have to show them your inner qualities. So if you have that kind of qualities focus 
on that so that they speak in and you can reply. So make it interesting, like if you say you love singing and
dancing there's nothing they can do.<br>
<strong>Q) Your further study plans?</strong><br>
A) I will give my CAT this year probably. If I like the company I am working in I will continue for 1 or 2
years but I will definitely give my CAT this year or next year. I will do my MBA.<br>
<strong>Q) Any advice for your juniors?</strong><br>
A) Keep enjoying and work hard. And please get involved in everything because four years matter a lot.
Get involved in clubs where you can meet your juniors, seniors and you can have good bonds, friendship,
memories which you will remember forever. Even our alumni says," These four years were the best four
years, WOW BIT!! Not many people will like BIT but you will definitely remember your college life." So
participate in everything, enjoy everything, study harder and work harder.<br>
Thank You Vineesha di for your time and views.<br></p>
